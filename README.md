# Exception Handling in C

An experiment I did as graduate student to explore and familiarise with c language and exception handling in general  

It presents and interface for exception-handling in ANSI C (C89 and subsequent ISO standards).

It builds on work done by Adam M. Costello <amc@cs.berkeley.edu> and Cosmin Truta <cosmin@cs.toronto.edu>.
